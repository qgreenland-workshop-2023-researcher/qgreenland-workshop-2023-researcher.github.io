## Workshop goals

* Build a shared familiarity with standard/open tools, formats, and practices.
* Create a more collaborative/open work environment for researchers.
* Learn to prepare datasets for use in the QGreenland QGIS data environment.


## ❤️  Built on open-source tools

📜 [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Manages workshop content and its history

🐙 [GitHub](https://github.com): Tools for developing in public and community
interaction

🇲 [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax): Text format for
representing workshop content

🌐 [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): Compiles our workshop content for publishing

📃 [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): Library for converting content between different
formats

📽️ [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/): Displays beautiful web slides

::: {.notes}
You may notice some rough edges in the workshop contents, for example tables of contents
that don't fit on the page. The website and slides are generated by open-source tools,
some of which are undergoing rapid development (e.g. Quarto).
